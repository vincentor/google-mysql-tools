#summary Patches for MySQL 5
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

The code has been changed to make MySQL more manageable, available and scalable. Many problems remain to be solved to improve SMP performance. This is a good start.

These have the same functionality as the MySQL 4 patches. There are several patch sets:
  * the [http://google-mysql-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mysql-patches/mysql-5.0.37-patches big V1 patch] published in 2007
  * the [http://google-mysql-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mysql-patches/mysql-5.0.37_semisync.patch semi-sync replication V1] patch published in 2007.
  * the big V2 patch to be published in 2008

SmpPerformance has results for a variety of MySQL versions on 4, 8 and 16 core servers.

= Disclaimer =

We have changed a lot of code. Not all of the changes are described here and some of the changes to default behavior from new my.cnf variables can break your applications. Unless your name rhymes with Domas, it might be better to take pieces of the patch rather than try to use all of it.

The code has been tested on 32-bit and 64-bit Linux. We may have broken the build for other platforms.

The embedded server, *--with-embedded-server*, cannot be built with these changes. We have broken the build for it.
