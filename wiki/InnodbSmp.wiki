InnoDB has been changed to run faster on SMP servers. The improvements are significant on servers with 8+ cores. The changes include:
   * use atomic memory operations for the Innodb mutex
   * use tcmalloc and disable the InnoDB memory heap (see [http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=38531 Bug38531])
   * use atomic memory operations for the Innodb rw-mutex.
