#summary Fast Master Promotion

= Introduction =

These commands allow fast promotion of a slave to a master. It is fast because it can be done without restarting the slave. Storage engines with dirty pages, such as InnoDB, can take a long time (more than a minute) to shutdown.

SQL statements include:
  * MAKE MASTER MASTER_LOG_FILE=<log_file>, MASTER_SERVER_ID=<id> [WITH BINLOG]
  * MAKE MASTER MASTER_LOG_FILE=<log_file>, MASTER_SERVER_ID=<id>, INDEX=<log_file.index> [WITH BINLOG]
  * MAKE MASTER REVOKE SESSION
  * MAKE MASTER REVOKE SESSION WITH KILL
  * MAKE MASTER GRANT SESSION

= MAKE MASTER MASTER_LOG_FILE ... =

This enables the use of the binlog on a slave without restarting mysqld.

= MAKE MASTER REVOKE SESSION =

This prevents non-SUPER users from connecting. When the *WITH KILL* option is used, current non-SUPER connections are killed.

= MAKE MASTER GRANT SESSION =

This allows non-SUPER users to connect.
