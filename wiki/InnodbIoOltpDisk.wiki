#summary Disk bound OLTP performance

This compares performance for tpcc-mysql with a data set that does not fit in the InnoDB buffer cache. The builds tested are the v4 Google patch (v4-5037), XtraDB with MySQL 5.1.34 (xtradb-5134) and unmodified MySQL 5.0.75 (mysql-5075).

The test configuration is:
  * 100 warehouses
  * 2G buffer cache
  * 16, 32 and 48 concurrent users
  * 1200 second warmup
  * 14400 second runtime
  * 8-core server, 10 disks, SW RAID 0, 1MB stripe, ext2

Tests were done with innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct set to 20 and 80. Only the v4 Google patch was able to come close to enforcing that limit.

== Results with innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct=20 ==

Results for the v4 Google patch and Xtradb with innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct=20.

Results for the v4 Google patch and Xtradb with innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct=80.
  * With XtraDB, performance gets worse at 80% dirty than at 20%. A similar result occurs for the insert benchmark. I don't understand why (yet).
