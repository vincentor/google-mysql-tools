#summary Make Innodb faster for IO bound workloads

= Introduction =

*NOTE* -- this is incomplete

This describes work to make InnoDB faster on IO bound workloads. The goal is to make it easy to use InnoDB on a server that can do 1000 to 10000 IOPs. A lot of problems must be fixed for that to be possible, but this is a big step towards that goal. These changes improve performance by 20% to more than 400% on several benchmarks. At a high level, these changes make InnoDB:
  * more efficient when processing IO requests
  * more likely to use available IO capacity
  * better at balancing different IO tasks
  * easier to monitor

One day, Heikki will write the _Complete Guide to InnoDB_, until then you need to consult multiple sources to understand the internals. It also helps to read the source code.

= Features =

  * [InnodbIoPerfStatus displays more data] in SHOW INNODB STATUS and SHOW STATUS including per-file IO statistics
  * [InnodbIoPerfCpu uses less CPU] while processing background IO requests
  * [InnodbIoPerfMaxDirty enforces innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct]
  * [InnodbIoPerfConfig adds my.cnf variable] to set the maximum size of the insert buffer
  * [InnodbIoPerfDelay prevents the insert buffer] from getting full (and becoming useless)
  * [InnodbIoPerfMain changes the main background IO thread] to be simpler and use more asynchronous IO
  * [InnodbIoPerfDelay delays user sessions] when limits are reached on the number of dirty buffer pool pages or the size of the insert buffer
  * [InnodbIoPerfConfig adds many my.cnf variables]

= Performance =

  * in-memory OLTP
  * disk-bound OLTP
  * insert benchmark
