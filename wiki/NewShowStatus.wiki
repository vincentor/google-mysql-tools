= Notes =

The new values include:
  * Binlog_events - number of replication events written to the binlog
  * Binlog_largest_event - larget event in the current binlog
  * Denied_connections - number of connection attempts that fail because of the max_connections limit
  * Malloc_sbrk_bytes_alloc, Malloc_chunks_free, Malloc_mmap_chunks_alloc, Malloc_mmap_bytes_alloc, Malloc_bytes_used, Malloc_bytes_free - values reported from mallinfo()
  * Vm_size, Vm_data, Vm_rss - data extracted from /proc for the mysqld process

Values for replication:
  * Replication_fail_io_connections - on a slave, number of times the IO thread has disconnected from the master because of an error
  * Replication_last_event_buffered - on a slave, time when last replication event received
  * Replication_last_event_done - on a slave, time when last replication event replayed
  * Rpl_mirror_binlog_clients - number of slaves connected to a slave serving from a mirror binlog
  * Rpl_mirror_binlog_status - indicates the health of the mirror binlog

Values for semi-synchronous replication:
  * Rpl_semi_sync_clients - number of semi-sync clients connected to a master
  * Rpl_semi_sync_net_avg_wait_time(us) - average time to wait for an acknowledgement of a replication event from a semi-sync slave
