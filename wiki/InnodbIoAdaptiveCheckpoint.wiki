#summary InnoDB Adaptive Checkpoint

This implements adaptive checkpoints for InnoDB. This feature was first [http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2008/11/13/adaptive-checkpointing done by Percona]. The code in the v4 patch is different but the benefits should be the same. This is enabled by the my.cnf variable _innodb_adaptive_checkpoint_.
