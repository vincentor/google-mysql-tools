Library for detecting drift between the master and slaves in a running system.

This code requires two features from the Google MySQL patch:
 * ORDERED_CHECKSUM()
 * LAST_VALUE()

It does a ratelimited scan of a configured set of databases/tables, generating
checkums from their data and writing them to a table (see checksums.sql). It
then copies the checksum values generated on the master to a second "golden"
table. The slave can then compare the values in the two tables; no discrepancies
means no drift.
